Many things can cause tiredness and fatigue:
- Cancer
- Depression
- Thyroid issues
- Diabetes
- Infection
- Sleep issues
- And many more!

Anyway, here is what you should ask:
1. Good morning, my name is Dr. XYZ. Can I get your name and date of birth please? @@html:<span class="ja">おはようございます、私はドクターXYZと申します。あなたのお名前と生年月日をお聞かせください。</span>@@
2. Thank you for coming today. @@html:<span class="ja">本日はご来場いただきありがとうございました。</span>@@
3. How can I help you?
4. Right, so you have been experiencing some tiredness. Can you tell me a little bit more about that?
5. /Give the patient some time to explain./ @@html:<span class="ja"><i>患者さんに説明する時間を与えてください。</i></span>@@
6. I will just do a quick summary of what you have told me so far.
7. /Do a quick summary./ @@html:<span class="ja"><i>簡単なまとめをしてください。</i></span>@@
8. So, how long have you been feeling tired for?
9. When did it start?
10. Has it become better or worse?
11. Is there a particular time of day where you feel most tired?
12. Does anything make it worse?
13. Do you have any ideas, concerns, and expectations?
14. Is it okay if I ask you few more questions?
15. How is your appetite?
16. How is your mood?
17. How is your sleep?
18. Have you had any recent infections?
19. Have you noticed weight changes?
20. Do you feel cold when others think it's warm? (you are checking for hypothyroidism).
21. How are your waterworks? (waterworks means urinary).
22. How are your bowel habits?
23. Any bleeding from anywhere?
24. Any pain?
25. Do you feel weak?
26. How is your concentration?
27. /Do a quick summary./ @@html:<span class="ja"><i>簡単なまとめをしてください。</i></span>@@
28. Then, do the rest of the history (past medical, past surgical, etc.)
